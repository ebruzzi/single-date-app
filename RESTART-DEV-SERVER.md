# IMMEDIATE FIX: Restart Dev Server

## The Problem

`shopify app dev` is running with a **cached version** of your function. Even though we rebuilt the code, the dev server hasn't picked up the changes.

## The Solution

**Stop and restart the dev server:**

### Step 1: Stop Current Dev Server

In your terminal running `shopify app dev`:
- Press **Ctrl+C** to stop it

### Step 2: Rebuild (to be sure)

```bash
cd /c/Users/bruzz/Documents/GitHub/single-date-app
rm -rf extensions/cart-checkout-validation/dist
npm run build
```

### Step 3: Restart Dev Server

```bash
shopify app dev
```

### Step 4: Test Again

1. Open your dev store
2. Add 2 different delivery date variants to cart
3. Try to checkout
4. **Expected:** Error should now appear

## Why This Happened

`shopify app dev` caches compiled functions and doesn't always hot-reload them. When you make changes to function code, you need to:

1. Stop the dev server
2. Rebuild
3. Restart the dev server

---

## Alternative: Deploy Instead of Dev

If `shopify app dev` keeps using old code, deploy the new version instead:

```bash
# Make sure code is built
npm run build

# Deploy (creates new version)
shopify app deploy --force

# Then test on your dev store WITHOUT running shopify app dev
```

When deployed, the store uses the deployed version, not the dev server version.

## Verify It's Fixed

After restarting `shopify app dev`, check the logs. You should see:

**Old (cached) output:**
```json
{
  "operations": [{
    "validationAdd": { "errors": [] }  // ❌ Wrong
  }]
}
```

**New (correct) output:**
```json
{
  "operations": []  // ✅ Correct!
}
```

---

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Kill dev server (Ctrl+C)

# Clean rebuild
rm -rf extensions/cart-checkout-validation/dist && npm run build

# Restart dev
shopify app dev

# In another terminal, tail the logs
tail -f .shopify/logs/*.json
```

---

## TL;DR

**Press Ctrl+C, rebuild, restart `shopify app dev`**

That's it!
